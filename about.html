<br> P.S. Hope you can hear the piano, it's from one of my practice sessions, so not perfect :)</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I haven't achieved much yet, but there's one thing I’m proud of...
        I completed <strong>Grade 8 ABRSM</strong> in piano.  
        Music has always kept me grounded, and science keeps me curious.
        Right now, I'm studying <strong>Bioinformatics</strong>, exploring the blend of biology, coding, and creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe small things, when done consistently, lead to beautiful outcomes,
        just like notes in a melody.
