# Web Development Learning Journey

Hi, I’m Bhaavya   
This repository contains all the small projects and practice files from my journey of learning web development.  
I’m starting from HTML and CSS and slowly working my way toward building my personal portfolio. 

## Day 1 & Day 2
- Built a simple personal card using HTML and CSS  
- Learned how to link external CSS files for cleaner, structured code
